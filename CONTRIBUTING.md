# Contributing to CheckMate2

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CheckMate2! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Branch Protection

The `main` branch should be protected with the following rules:

> These rules must be configured in GitHub branch protection settings for the repository and may not be present in forks by default.

- **Pull request reviews required** — At least one approving review is required before merging.
- **No direct pushes** — All changes must go through a pull request.
- **Status checks must pass** — The following CI checks should be required before merging:
  - **Backend Build & Test** — Backend build and test validation
  - **Frontend Build & Lint** — Frontend build and lint validation

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Follow the setup instructions in [README.md](README.md) to get the app running.
3. Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b my-feature`).

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
